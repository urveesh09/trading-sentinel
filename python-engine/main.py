    [AUDIT-FIX-2.2 2026-06-25] Centralised auth-gate for internal
    endpoints (/positions/manual, /positions/close, /api/internal/*,
    the CNC alert webhook target).

    Behaviour:
      - INTERNAL_API_SECRET env var is set + caller sends the right
        value -> allow.
      - INTERNAL_API_SECRET env var is set + caller sends wrong/missing
        value -> 403 (same as before; this fix doesn't change it).
      - INTERNAL_API_SECRET env var is EMPTY (not set in .env) -> 503.
        This is louder than 403 and tells the operator the endpoint
        is misconfigured, not that the caller is wrong. The system
        STAYS UP (other endpoints work) but refuses to mutate until
        the secret is configured.

    Why this matters: pre-fix, an empty secret defaulted `if secret !=
    ""` to True, allowing ANY caller (including an attacker on the
    docker network) to invoke internal endpoints by sending
    `X-Internal-Secret: ` (empty string). With the empty-secret
    setting, the attacker could close positions, send manual positions,
    etc.

    Why not hard-fail at startup: per operator mandate (2026-06-25),
    internal endpoints going down must NOT block the system during
    market hours. We log + refuse requests + emit Telegram alert, but
    the scanner loop keeps running.
