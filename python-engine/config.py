    # noise, so the exit is close to a coin flip: 2 wins in 8 momentum trades.

    # A 0.5% floor therefore hands ~a fifth of every unit of risk to the broker
    # before the trade has an opinion, which is exactly how 27-30 Jul produced a
    # gross P&L of MINUS Rs 0.35 alongside Rs 17.90 of costs. It also sat inside
    # the noise: 8 of 8 trades ran 0.52-1.16% stops and not one was ever hit.

    # [STOP-NOISE 2026-07-31] The 0.5% percentage floor is still inside intraday
    # noise for most mid-caps. Four days of live trades (27-30 Jul) ran stops of
    # 0.52-1.16%, and all 8 exited on the clock between -0.71R and +0.49R: the
    # stop was never hit, the target was never reached, and the R-multiple
    # measured nothing. Because sizing divides the risk budget by the stop
    # distance, a too-tight stop ALSO maximises share count and therefore
    # turnover -- those 8 trades produced a gross P&L of MINUS Rs 0.35 against
    # Rs 17.90 of costs. Costs were 10-23% of 1R.
    #
    # An ATR-proportional floor fixes both ends at once: the stop sits outside
    # the day's noise, and at constant rupee risk the wider stop cuts share
    # count, turnover and therefore cost drag (a 0.6% -> 1.8% stop on the same
    # risk budget is ~3x fewer shares and ~3x less cost).
    # The multiplier is NOT free: it has to coexist with the MC5 fuel gate,

    # NIFTY weeklies typically print 120-250, so the §3 "self-regulation"
    # rejected essentially every candidate every day and the 60-trade
    # go-live bar was unreachable. At 250k the pool-derived cap is

    #
    # The old figure was not a pool, it was an alibi. At Rs 250,000 the promotion
    # ladder's drawdown budget was Rs 62,500 -- more than 7x the entire REAL
    # account (Rs 8,000 across all live books) -- so Rs 10,841 of paper losses,
    # from the worst-performing book in the system (1 win in 8), still reported as
    # "within budget". FNO_MAX_OPEN_PREMIUM_PCT=0.15 also licensed Rs 37,500 of

    # was raised. Recorded here so the reasoning is not re-litigated each audit.

    #   min_viable_pool = premium * lot_size * FNO_STOP_PREMIUM_PCT / FNO_MAX_RISK_PCT

    # The real NIFTY premiums this book traded (Rs 151.85-165.10 on a 65 lot)
    # demand Rs 123,375-134,150 for ONE lot, so anything at or below ~Rs 135,000
    # rejects every trade `pool_below_min_viable` and silently switches the book
    # off. 250,000 clears that comfortably.
    #
    # The known cost: the promotion ladder's drawdown budget is
    # FNO_PAPER_BANKROLL * PROMOTION_MAX_DD_PCT = Rs 62,500, which is ~7.8x the
    # entire REAL account (Rs 8,000). That is how Rs 10,841 of losses from the
    # worst-performing book in the system (1 win in 8) still reported as "within
    # budget" through July.
    #
    # What stops that mattering is no longer the pool number: promotion_report's
    # structural-viability gate blocks F&O on the ground that one lot
    # (cheapest ever entered: Rs 5,967) costs more than the whole real account
    # (Rs 4,500 Nifty seed). That check reads REAL capital and is completely
